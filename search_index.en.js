This time fortunately, we are in luck though as Google made it's public Custom Search Engine API available for everyone for free.\nGoogle Custom Search Engine (CSE)\nGoogle's CSE allows us to create a custom search engine specifically configured to our requirements whether it is prioritizing search results from specific websites or searching our web only.\nImportant thing to know is if configured correctly, it can search for results on the entire web!\nThe following are few simple steps you will need to take, to setup your search API:\n\nCreate your own custom search engine https://cse.google.com/cse/all and get Search engine ID from the settings panel\n  \n      \n  \n  Google CSE ID\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder Basics settings section where you got your CSE ID, find and enable Search the entire web option.\n\n\nGet API key for the created search engine.\n\n  \n      \n  \n  Google CSE API key\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we can use our CSE ID and API key to make a GET API request to https://www.googleapis.com/customsearch/v1?key=yourkey&amp;cx=yourid&amp;q=query\nHere is NodeJS code example which does not require any dependencies that you can copy paste:\n\n\nconst https = require('https');\n\n/**\n * @param {Object} options\n * @param {String} options.key - Google API key\n * @param {String} options.cx - Search Engine ID\n * @param {String} options.q - search query\n *\n * ...for list of all supported options, see\n * https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/reference/rest/v1/cse/list\n *\n * @returns {Promise&lt;Object&gt;}\n */\nfunction search(options) {\n    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n        let query = '';\n\n        //serialize url query parameters\n        Object.keys(options || {}).forEach(function(prop) {\n            query += prop+'='+encodeURIComponent(options[prop])+'&amp;';\n        });\n\n        //api request options\n        const opt = {\n            hostname: 'www.googleapis.com',\n            port: 443,\n            path: `/customsearch/v1?${query}`,\n            method: 'GET',\n            headers: { Accept: 'application/json' }\n        }\n\n        //response data\n        let data = '';\n\n        const req = https.request(opt, res =&gt; {\n\n            //process incomming response data stream\n            res.on('data', chunk =&gt; {\n                data += chunk;\n            });\n\n            //when end of stream is reached and there is no more data to read\n            //return resolve or rejected promise,\n            //depending on response http status code\n            res.on('end', () =&gt; {\n                if (res.statusCode &gt;= 200 &amp;&amp; res.statusCode &lt; 300) {\n                    resolve(JSON.parse(data));\n                } else {\n                    reject(data);\n                }\n            });\n        });\n\n        req.on('error', error =&gt; {\n            reject(error);\n        });\n\n        req.end();\n    });\n};\n\nYou can use the search function as follows:\nconst response = await search({\n    cx: '001111568431131411111:aa33rweuabc',\n    key: 'AKDYksKYicBgvX6k7G8mFWCABo0HqelXM7dOsA0',\n    q: 'How to programmatically get google search results'\n});\n\n//dumps search results\nconsole.log(response.items);\n\nAnd there you have it, a lightweight solution which does not require you to regularly update scraping code nor install a ton of dependencies. More importantly, it uses official API supported by Google.\nThere are few considerations that are helpful to make though.\nCSE doesn't include features such as personalized results, oneboxes etc.. and sometimes it might give slightly different results than when scraping the data from google's website.\nHowever, from my own experience with using CSE, the differences in search results have been insignificant.\n","id":"https://fogine.dev/blog/how-to-programmatically-get-google-search-results/","title":"How to programmatically get google search results"},"https://fogine.dev/blog/my-working-environment/":{"body":"As I spend significant amount of time working with computers, it's important to me to have a desktop environment which does not distract me from work.\nMoreover I expect my system environment to help me be more productive and to complement my habits in context of how I interact with the environment.\nIn this post I'm gonna describe how is my linux installation setup and main tools I use on every day basic for past 6 years and why.\nDo not expect configuration tutorial but rather high-level toolset overview.\nOS distribution - Archlinux\n\nAs majority of current Arch users, I started using Xubuntu (Ubuntu with xfce desktop environment instead of gnome) as my first UNIX based OS.\nXubuntu was certainly better than Windows as it allowed me to \"hack\" it around and more importantly, it had a proper shell.\nHowever, at the end of the day, it was my unorthodox doing that led to all kind of crashes during system upgrade and ultimately was forcing me to reinstall the system.\nLesson learned: Ubuntu is a robust preconfigured system made for general public, not necessary for developers, serving as out of the box conventional desktop everybody is familiar with.\nIt wasn't until some years later when a colleague of mine introduced me to Archlinux distro, that solved most of my issues.\nThese are Archlinux features that make it a superior distribution for me personally:\n\nIt includes base system only and its up to you to install and configure everything else that you need.\nArch uses rolling release system as opposed to Ubuntu's discrete release system - this means that packages are always up to date, you don't have to wait 6 months for system upgrade nor use custom repositories with updated package versions. This is a big one for me! \nIts WIKI pages are far from any other knowledge base available. They provide comprehensive and well-arranged information about Linux in general. Its my GO-TO information source for Linux.\n\nSystem configuration - dotfiles\nAll configuration files are tracked in (public) git repository and reside in single .dotfiles directory (check it out if you want to see how something is configured).\nIn there, configuration files are organized in separate folders by topic and symlinked into $HOME when you run script/bootstrap.\nThis makes it really simple to add and edit configuration and when you need to reinstall once in roughly 5 years, you run single command to get everything setup exactly how it was before.\nWindow manager - i3wm\ni3 is a tiling window manager.\nTiling window managers organize windows in a grid of tiles so that 100% of the screen space is always in use.\n\nNote: You can still have classic floating windows but those are almost always redundant.\nUsually, the user creates, deletes, moves, resizes or focuses windows with shortcuts (in addition to mouse navigation). Mine are defined in such way so that they match vim-like window manipulation mappings:\nActionShortcut\nFocus left windowSuper+h\nFocus right windowSuper+l\nFocus up windowSuper+k\nFocus bottom windowSuper+j\nClose windowSuper+q\n......\n\nSince I use Vim as my main editor, having the same shortcuts that do the same thing globally at system level, not just in the editor, makes it really convenient.\nI'm too lazy to travel with my right hand from keyboard to mouse and back just so I can focus different window...\nThere are also 10 workspaces available which can contain different running applications. I switch between them with Super+&lt;0-9&gt; mappings.\nTerminal multiplexer - tmux\n\ntmux is a terminal multiplexer. It lets you switch easily between several programs in one terminal, detach them (they keep running in the background) and reattach them to a different terminal.\nsource: https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki\n\nShell - zsh\nWhat makes zsh superior to regular bash are its autosuggestions &amp; tab-completion &amp; syntax-highlighting features.\nLets look at some examples:\n\n    \n        \n    \n    zsh tab completion\n\nThe grey text behind cursor that you can see in the preview suggests best matching command based on what you have typed so far and on your shell command history.\nYou can accept suggested command anytime with Ctrl+e.\nMoreover if you want to see list of available commands or arguments from man pages, you just press Tab key.\nAlso you can notice that git command is highlighted with green-ish color - that signalizes that command is recognized and the shell can find appropriate file with executable flag.\nI also use some navigation tools that make a shell whole a lot more intuitive:\n\nz: jump around\nz tracks your most used directories, based on 'frecency'.\nAfter  a  short  learning  phase, z will take you to the most 'recent'\ndirectory that matches a pattern given on the command line.\n\nIn addition to z, I've configured number aliases 1,2...and so on to cd -1, cd -2... which change your current dirrectory to the previous one.\n\nCtrl-R: search command history\nThis utility plays really well with the other zsh features as it complements completion of more complex commands that I rarely use and can't quickly type out off the top of my head.\n\n  \n      \n  \n  zsh search history\n\n\n\nEditor - vim\nvim does not need an introduction. Everybody in the field has at least heard of it. And if I exaggerate a bit, its either the greatest piece of software or source of fear and frustration.\nIt's out of the scope of this article to go through individual mappings and plugins I use.\nHowever if you want to see the plugin list, its available HERE.\n\n    \n        \n    \n    vim editor\n\nWhat are those fancy arrow-like UI segments? You are asking... Those are custom status lines for vim &amp; tmux and zsh, powered by powerline plugin.\nFile manager - vifm\nvifm is a curses based vim-like file manager.\nIt's like Total Commander but better.\nIf you use vim, you will love vifm.\n\n    \n        \n    \n    vifm\n\nSystem-wide interface - dmenu / rofi\nIf you got all the way down here, you may be asking where are some buttons, where is my system bar with time and tray area with application icons or start menu? The answer is simple, there are not any.\nI have found out I do not need any system wide status bar with icons and basic information like date-time etc... It would be wasting of screen space the most of the time anyway and source of distraction.\nSo how do I start applications, turn off the computer, connect to wifi or manage removable devices like usb flash drives, you are asking? I use dmenu or rofi.\nWhat is dmenu and rofi\ndmenu is a dynamic menu. The user gives it possible menu options as the input, and it creates a graphical menu with one item per line. The user can then select an item, through the arrow keys or typing a part of the name, and selected option is returned as the output. The user then takes the output, lets say it's Power-off and implements the action - powers down the computer.\nrofi is more powerful dmenu\nSo in practice, applications are built around dmenu that are focusing on single task, like system power management, wifi connection, mouting/umouting removable devices etc...\nYou bind the application to a shortcut (or button) eg. Super+m and dmenu will popup a list eg.: of connected flash drives that you can mount or umount.\n\n    \n        \n    \n    Example: application launcher\n\n\n    \n        \n    \n    Example: mouting/umouting removable devices (eg.: flash drives)\n\n","id":"https://fogine.dev/blog/my-working-environment/","title":"My working environment"},"https://fogine.dev/blog/serviser-framework-introduction/":{"body":"Is writing and maintaining up to date documentation for your APIs a pain for you?\nDo you miss an environment where it is safe to raise exceptions and not to worry about how they will propagate and be processed?\nWhat about having out of the box solution for validating complex input and output data structures without it polluting your domain logic?\nThese were the main reasons of my motivation to create yet another Node.js web framework (serviser).\n\nMinimalist frameworks like expressjs do excelent job of providing us with bare-bones web server features and are great starting point for a project.\nHowever it's left up to the developer to build rigid project foundations.\nDevelopers need to worry about how they are gonna handle all the async &amp; sync errors and even create bridges between callback &amp; promise patterns. They need to make sure that internal exceptions get logged and do not leak as part of a response or cause nodejs process to crash.\nA lot of additional setup work needs to be done including solutions for service configuration, data validation, request identification and more.\nChances are that the developer has a set of middlewares (plugins) that help minimize boilerplate code.\nAlthough that being very flexible approach, it has considerable disadvantage in it being more error-prone solution as the developer can not avoid reinventing the wheel in terms of integrating everything together.\nTaking more robust approach when laying down project foundations allows for better consistency in terms of behavior and makes the application more reliable and scalable.\nThe goal of the serviser framework is to provide out of the box rigid base for web applications and allow for faster production ready development while keeping the core functionality lightweight with modular, swappable plugin based architecture.\nMain features:\n\n\nshell integration \n\nrun single process / cluster mode\ninspect http endpoints or service configuration\nuser defined commands\n\n\n\nError handling and logging\n\n\nResource management\n\n\nPowerful Input and Output data validation\n\n\nOpenAPI integration\n\nAPI documentation (in form of frontend application) autogeneration from code\n\n\n\nEven though the library has been production tested in multiple commercial projects, it has not found its community yet.\nAny contributions are welcome and greatly appreciated!\nIn the next post we will go through tutorial on how to build simple API service with serviser.\n","id":"https://fogine.dev/blog/serviser-framework-introduction/","title":"Serviser framework - introduction"},"https://fogine.dev/blog/using-github-issues-for-blog-comments/":{"body":"In the past, disqus was the solution to go for when you needed a functionality for your static website that would enable people to post comments and ask questions under your posts.\nWith it's free tier, you would get a package with basic features. It comes with a price though of it being relatively heavy solution.\nIt's ads supported and increases page weight by factor of 10! Not to mention it lets other applications like Facebook to track your visitors.\nSo recently when I was in middle of integration of disqus plugin to this blog, I decided to revisit my product of choice and explore other options in nowadays product driven market.\n\nScroll down for DLDR;\nIt did not take long to find few very interesting alternatives.\nFor example Talkyard and Commento are open-source projects with focus on privacy and come with all major features. You can host them eg.: on heroku for free or pay reasonable price for product as a service.\nAlthough they are both robust solutions which I do not need for my use case.\nHowever, Staticman was the project that cough my eye:\n\nStaticman is a Node.js application that receives user-generated content and uploads it as data files to a GitHub and/or GitLab repository. In practice, this allows you to have dynamic content (e.g. blog post comments) as part of a fully static website, as long as your site automatically deploys on every push to GitHub and/or GitLab.\n\nIt'd still require me to host my own server though.\nAt this point I got an idea - since I host this blog on GitHub, I could create a comment system which would integrate with GitHub Issues.\nWhen somebody comments on my blog I'd use GitHub API to create an issue and store the discussion there. For my target audience this would be ideal solution!\nIt turned out that there is already a GitHub widget for that. It's called utterances.\nTLDR;\n\nHere is how it works:\n\nYou as a blog owner install Utterances GitHub App on the GitHub repository that hosts comments.\nYou as a blog owner include simple script where you want the comments to load:\n\n&lt;script src=\"https://utteranc.es/client.js\"\n        repo=\"fogine/blog\"\n        issue-term=\"pathname\"\n        label=\"Comment\"\n        theme=\"github-dark-orange\"\n        crossorigin=\"anonymous\"\n        async&gt;\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\n\nThe script uses the GitHub issue search API to find the issue associated with the page based on post's pathname. \nIf an issue does not exist, utterances-bot will create it first time someone comments.\nTo comment, users must authorize the utterances app to create issues (for the blog repository only) on their behalf.\nAlternatively, users can comment on the GitHub issue directly.\n\nConsidering limitations of using GitHub Issue tracker service to power blog comments:\n\nIt's features are basic. For example, you can't reply to someone's comment (You can quote him though).\nGitHub's Search API is rate limited to 5000 requests/hour. Which is a little really. So if (I mean When) this blog gets popular enough, I'll have to come with solution that actually scales.\n\nYou can see it in action, bellow ⌄⌄⌄\n","id":"https://fogine.dev/blog/using-github-issues-for-blog-comments/","title":"Using GitHub Issues for Blog Comments"},"https://fogine.dev/contact/":{"body":"I'm happy to get message from you — hit me on Twitter or\nemail me on mail at davidlasek dot eu.\n","id":"https://fogine.dev/contact/","title":"contact me"},"https://fogine.dev/pages/":{"body":"","id":"https://fogine.dev/pages/","title":""}},"docInfo":{"https://fogine.dev/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://fogine.dev/about/":{"body":90,"title":0},"https://fogine.dev/archive/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://fogine.dev/blog/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://fogine.dev/blog/how-to-programmatically-get-google-search-results/":{"body":383,"title":4},"https://fogine.dev/blog/my-working-environment/":{"body":710,"title":2},"https://fogine.dev/blog/serviser-framework-introduction/":{"body":237,"title":3},"https://fogine.dev/blog/using-github-issues-for-blog-comments/":{"body":287,"title":5},"https://fogine.dev/contact/":{"body":10,"title":1},"https://fogine.dev/pages/":{"body":0,"title":0}},"length":10}};
